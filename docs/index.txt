Getting started

#. Download the code base templates
#. Create a virtual environment
#. Install project dependencies

It's recommended to work in a virtual environment, since this project has its
own dependencies to automate testing of your work. Built-in `venv`_ and `pip`_
modules should be enough to complete your workspace preparation.

Downloading the code base
=========================

.. todo: section description

Initializing virtual environment
================================

To create a brand new virtual for your project, navigate to its home directory
via your terminal. Once you're in the right place, do:

.. hint:: You are free to choose any name you like for your environment.
          Regular command pattern is ``python -m venv {env_name}``. Common
          names are: ``.venv``, ``.env``, ``venv``, ``env``, ``Venv``, ``Env``
          etc.

.. code-block:: shell

    python -m venv .venv

A new directory named after your choice will appear in the project directory.

.. note:: Virtual environment is configured for **your** target system and is
          useless on other computers. There will be a dedicated env created on
          each machine. So, **should not** become a part of a project. Include
          it to ``.gitignore`` file to avoid adding and it to your repository.

Activating and deactivating virtual environment
===============================================

**Prerequisites:**

- virtual environment is created

Before you start working - your virtual environment should be activated.
The activation script is already created within your *venv* directory.
You are just to run it.

Activate on Windows:

.. code-block:: shell

    .venv\Scripts\activate

Activate on Unix (macOS and Linux distros):

.. code-block:: shell

    source .venv/bin/activate

To deactivate type ``deactivate`` to your terminal and hit **Enter** key.

.. code-block::

    deactivate

Installing dependencies
=======================

.. note:: It's recommended to work in a virtual environment.

**Prerequisites:**

- `pip`_ is installed
  (`installation guide <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/>`_)
- Internet connection is available

The project's dependencies are listed in ``requirements.txt`` file and it's all
you need to get them installed. Navigate to the directory with this file though
your terminal and do:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Running tests local
===================

**Prerequisites:**

- dependencies are installed

You can run tests, prepared for this project locally to check your code. There
are two tools used to evaluate your code base:

- pytest
- pylint

Testing configurations are already included to this project.

Run ``pylint``:

.. code-block:: shell

    pylint src

Run ``pytest``:

.. code-block:: shell

    pytest

.. _venv: https://docs.python.org/library/venv.html
.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io
